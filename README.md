## Planning Story

In planning for this project, I decided that I would first start by working on the API side of things to make sure that my server was running and that there were no bugs in it before I moved on to the client. Once the API was done, then I began to work on the client and slowly connected each RESTful action up to work with the API until the application was complete. This approach helped to dilute the amount of errors I ran into during development and it was easier to know where the issue was when something stopped working.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB / Mongoose

### Unsolved Problems

- I want to add comments to posts, which would required another model and another set of routes
